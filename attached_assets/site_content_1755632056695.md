- Packaged heat pumps pack all the benefits of a cost-efficient electric heating and cooling unit‚Äîplus a powerful fan coil‚Äîinto a single unit.
- If you‚Äôre looking for an energy-efficient heating and cooling solution, geothermal heat pumps have plenty of upside all year long‚Äîespecially come tax time. These units are still eligible for Federal tax credits worth up to 30% off the installed cost.
- Ductless heat pumps are the no-brainer solution for cooling and seasonal heating if your home has no existing ductwork or you have a room addition or other special need.
